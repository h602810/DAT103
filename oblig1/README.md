# DAT103 - Oblig 1
## Obligatory Assignment - Words Reversal

The assignment will demonstrate:
* How a simple algorithm is run at the hardware level, i.e. how high-level program code translates to assembly. To this end, you will implement a function that reverses the order of words in a string.
* How the Unix shell can be used to automate tasks and to tie low-level programs (like this string reversal) together to do more complicated work. In the example, this entails pre- and post-processing of the input, and storage of auxiliary data.


This project consists of two parts:
> Part I: A bash script that reads input, splits it up, uses standard tools to categorize it and writes/reads some
files, in order to make it simpler to reverse the words.

> Part II: An assembly program that does the simplified reversal operation.
